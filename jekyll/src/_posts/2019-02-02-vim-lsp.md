title: Vim + Language Server Protocol—in 2019.
tags: dotfiles

A common observation can be made with newcomers to Vim; plethoras of plugins
transform the minimal editor into something vaguely resembling an IDE. Often,
it's not long until "autocompletion" comes up, and how Vim's apparent _lack_
thereof spawns posts titled "I can't get YouCompleteMe to work"...

If that sounds uncanny, I speak from a similar experience—like others before me,
I too tried YouCompleteMe, Eclim, Tern, Jedi... you may be unsurprised to know
**I uninstalled the lot**, committing instead to learn Vim's built-in
autocompletion. If you take one thing from this post, please let it be to study
`:help ins-completion`—`<C-x><C-l>` still provides what I need 9 times out of
10.

## But then came Language Servers.

Whilst developing _[VS Code][vscode-site]_, Microsoft introduced the [Language
Server Protocol][lsp-site] (LSP): an interface between **servers** and **text
editors** in which the servers provide text-editors with autocomplete
capabilities (et. al). These LSP-compliant servers—or Language Servers—are
different to traditional autocomplete engines in that they are vendor agnostic;
they run as stand-alone programs on a host machine instead of being bundled
within text-editors.

In practice this means you can install one Language Server, and have many
LSP-compliant text-editors use it. The inverse of this relationship means you
can install _one_ LSP plugin in your text-editor, and profit for as many
Language Servers you have installed:

![vim lsp][img-vim-lsp]

## Installing, configuring & using Language Servers.

Hopefully, this is starting to sound feasible to you—at least conceptually. In
my experience, the least documented/intuitive part of Language Servers is
**installing**, **configuring** and **using** them. Take for instance this
configuration advertised by the [autozimu/LanguageClient-neovim][lsp-plugin]
plugin:

```vim
let g:LanguageClient_serverCommands = {
    \ 'rust': ['~/.cargo/bin/rustup', 'run', 'stable', 'rls'],
    \ 'javascript': ['/usr/local/bin/javascript-typescript-stdio'],
    \ 'javascript.jsx': ['tcp://127.0.0.1:2089'],
    \ 'python': ['/usr/local/bin/pyls'],
    \ }
```

Without digging into the source code, this configuration suggests you can:
<ol type="A">
  <li>Boot up a Language Server by pointing to a binary on the host, or</li>
  <li>Connect to a Language Server that is already listening on a socket.</li>
</ol>
Let's explore the two options now.

### Option A: Boot up a Language Server.

![vim lsp][img-vim-spawn]

This is probably the quickest way to get started—you can install a JavaScript
Language Server via  `$ npm install -g javascript-typescript-langserver`, and
then configure [LanguageClient-neovim][lsp-plugin] to use the global
`javascript-typescript-stdio` binary.  Boom, job done for JavaScript.

Want LSP for Python, too? Sure, `$ pip install python-language-server` and point
[LanguageClient-neovim][lsp-plugin] to the global `pyls`... Alright... now
imagine repeating this process for multiple languages; C#, Java, Go, Ruby,
Bash...  Okay... Now what if you have multiple machines—say a laptop for
personal use, and another one for work? Well, installing them all over again is
getting kinda _tedious_... **But shit**—the different laptops have installed the
Language Servers into subtly different locations, and now your [shared
dotfiles][dotfiles] are broken.

Option B then?

### Option B: Connect to a Language Server via TCP.

![vim lsp connect][img-vim-connect]

Alright this requires a little upfront effort, but with it I have **integrated
LSP into my everyday workflow**—something [I'm a stickler
for][1k-dotfile-commits]. The key difference is we shift responsibility for the
Language Server's life-cycle to the host machine, as opposed to the
[LanguageClient-neovim][lsp-plugin] plugin. Put another way, when we are able to
guarantee a Language Server is listening on a specific port, this provides a
contract needed to decouple Vim from machine-specific idiosyncrasies:

```vim
# Option A: Vim is coupled to location of Language Server
# binary, As the path can change, the config is brittle!

let g:LanguageClient_serverCommands = {
    \ 'javascript': ['/usr/local/bin/javascript-typescript-stdio']
    \ }

# Option B: So long as a Language Server is listening on
# port 2089 somehow, Vim doesn't care.

let g:LanguageClient_serverCommands = {
    \ 'javascript': ['tcp://127.0.0.1:2089']
    \ }
```

To make the host machine responsible for the Language Servers, start the
Language Servers as system daemons. For example—given I run macOS—I copied a
[JavaScript Language Server plist][javascript-plist] into the
`~/Library/LaunchAgents` directory, and executed the `$ launchctl load
~/Library/LaunchAgents/js-lsp.plist` command. This ensures the Language Server
will listen on port `2089` when I log in, and shut down when I log out. Neat
right?! If you want another example, [here's a plist][python-plist] for the
Python Language Server that listens on port `2090`.

### Automate, automate.

I'll wrap this section up by imploring you to automate Language Server
installation. Daemon files (such as the `*.plist`s) are usually text files,
which makes them ripe for committing and installing with your dotfiles.  The
astute reader may have already noticed I embed my `plist` files into [Homebrew
Formulae][homebrew-formulae], which means [I can commit them into a
`.Brewfile`][brewfile], execute `$ brew bundle install` and chill out whilst
[Homebrew][homebrew] install the Language Servers as system daemons. Easy life!

If you want to try this out for yourself, run the following commands:

```sh
# Install the formula.
brew tap kieran-bamforth/repo
# Install the JavaScript language server on port 2090.
brew install kieran-bamforth/javascript-typescript-langserver
# See that it is running!
brew services ls
```

## Augment Vim with your new Language Server.

Thanks for sticking with me so far, the hard effort will pay off. All we have to
do now is to configure some keyboard shortcuts for the Language Server—you'll be
well on your way!

Before rushing off to invent a new shortcut, it's always worth asking **can we
augment Vim's existing functionality?**. Take for instance, the _jump to a
symbol declaration_ feature provided by Language Servers... it lines up with
Vim's _go to local declaration_ feature nicely, don't you think?. Let's remap
`gd` to take advantage of this:

```vim
nnoremap <buffer> <silent> gd \
    :call LanguageClient#textDocument_definition()<CR>
```

This key-binding works nicely until we use `gd` in a buffer that is not
associated with a Language Server—Vim will do nothing. This scenario is a good
candidate for _graceful degradation_—that is—if the Language Server does
nothing, fall back to Vim's built in functionality. Here' an iteration of the
previous snippet that takes into account _graceful degradation_:

```vim
autocmd FileType * call LanguageClientMaps()

function! LanguageClientMaps()
    if has_key(g:LanguageClient_serverCommands, &filetype)
    nnoremap <buffer> <silent> gd \
        :call LanguageClient#textDocument_definition()<CR>
    endif
endfunction
```

Can you think other Vim-features worth augmenting? The "hover" feature from
Language Servers aligns pretty nicely with Vim's "keyword lookup" (`help K`),
for instance.  [Please share][my-lsp-bindings] yours in the comments!

## Vim + Language Server Protocol—in 2019.

I introduced the concept of Language Servers by talking exclusively about the
[LanguageClient-neovim][lsp-plugin] plugin—but it's well worth remembering there
are others out there ([vim-lsp][vim-lsp], [ALE][ale], etc). In fact, I [extended
ALE][extend-ale] to use Language Servers before moving onto
[LanguageClient-neovim][lsp-plugin].

Eagle-eyed readers may notice the aforementioned [ALE
configuration][javascript-config-ale] uses the same ports as successive
[LanguageClient configuration][javascript-config-languageclient]. This is no
accident! In fact, I think this empirically proves Microsoft's vision for the
LSP; I was able to upgrade my text-editor easily independently of any
autocomplete engines—[**just check out how easy it was**][replace-ale].

Composing small, sharp tools together is a creative task; the aggregates of
which go can solve unlimited problems. It is no accident we can pipe the output
of one shell command into the next, for the UNIX philosophy states "the
universal interface is text". It is by agreeing and complying to interfaces our
tooling can thrive—and this is _precisely_ what LSP provides for our
text-editors in 2019.
