If you were to browse the most popular Hacker News posts of 2022, it would read
like Machine Learning has crossed into the collective consciousness of the
[late majority](https://userguiding.com/blog/technology-adoption-curve/).
Models like [Stable-Diffusion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stable_Diffusion)
and [ChatGPT](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ChatGPT) made regular sensational
headlines ranging from admiration, tounge-in-cheek applications and of course
controversy.

As a distant cousin working in the software field I find it difficult to
imagine that conversations surrounding these innovations will fade back into
computer-science obscurity because their by-effects can already be observed in
the microcosms of Art and Education industries.
